<p>When downloading data from a cloud app, you need to provide that app's API key when making requests to PetalData. See the authentication section for each dataset for information.</p>
<p>If you are downloading more than 10,000 rows, a PetalData API key is also required. Email <a href="mailto:support@petaldata.app">support@petaldata.app</a> to obtain an API key.</p>
